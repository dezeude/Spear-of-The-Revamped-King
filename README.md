# Spear-of-The-Revamped-King

## Overview

This is the new and improved version of my old highschool project: [Spear of The King](https://github.com/dezeude/Spear-of-The-Revamped-King)
I have learned a lot since first starting the project in May (or April) 2022, and I want to do things right; fixing all my mistakes and improving the quality overall.

# Spear-of-The-King

This is a small project that I started a while ago, but haven't finished yet because of procrastination and motivational issues. I started this project to understand how games were made from scratch using code without a game engine and with minimal libraries. This project doesn't have any external libraries apart from the base JRE libraries from Java 11 and [JOML](https://github.com/JOML-CI/JOML). You can run the "SoTK.jar" file in the root directory to see where the game is at right now. (There's not much lol)
This was a really fun project and I hope I get more motivation to eventually finish it, lol.

## The Game

**Spear of The King** is a 2D platformer game that follows the life of a young warrior (unnamed lol) with amnesia, who is tasked with saving the kingdom from monsters. At least that was the original plan, but there's no real gameplay. You can move with WASD, attack with left click, and interact with spacebar. 

## Skills

I am a primarily self-taught programmer, and I learned to use Java and Eclipse through YouTube, multiple short tutorial websites, and reading the Java docs 

## Assets

None of the art is made by me! I used many different assets from different people on itch.io
